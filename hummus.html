      <h3>Hummus Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        I like hummus. Here are my (and friends) reviews of store-bought hummus
        brands around Vancouver. Based off of

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>fontaine sante, traditional</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>7.5 (by definition, acts as a baseline for comparison)</li>
          <li>
            morgan: very bright flavor, love the lemon. this brand/flavor is the
            reason I love hummus
          </li>
          <li>
            shen: i cannot lie. do somehow forget what it tastes like every time
            until i put in it in my mouth and then i fully understand how morgan
            ate the entire tub i bought (that he said he did not want any of)
            AND half of my subsequent hummus reparations. the flavour hits u
            with the perfect amount of lemon.. consistency never misses.. a
            classic for a reason n truly fun for the whole family.. they need to
            sell this in 2kg tubs again..
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>fontaine sante, roasted red pepper</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            morgan (6): the whole time im just wishing it was the traditional
            flavour, tastes like too vegetable-y
          </li>
          <li>
            shen (5.5): i am not one to go hate on vegetables. some may even
            call me a vegetable appreciator. but this tastes like when you bite
            into an orange bell pepper like it's an apple and chew it for a
            little too long. and then if you spooned some hummus into your mouth
            as an afterthought. like a mom sneaking broccoli into her picky
            kid's mac n cheese. not the worst thing in the world but if i am
            eating veggies, i would like to eat them knowing that it was a
            decision i made on my own. am also probably eating this with veggies
            anyways. so. do not appreciate this (rather unnecessary) flavour
            addition to an otherwise solid hummus. also do not appreciate people
            who say that peppers are technically fruit. one more thing. where is
            the roasted aspect to this. all that being said. would not be mad if
            i had to eat this. but would certainly not be my first choice!!
          </li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        <strong>habibi's basil &amp; garlic</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            morgan (5): woah, lots of basil and garlic. hard to open the
            package, and much thicker than the fontaine sante varieties (almost
            broke the cracker). hummus should be about chickpeas & lemon, this
            is not that (feels like its trying to distract you from those)
          </li>
          <li>
            shen (5): can this really be classified as hummus.. Much To
            Consider.. consistency reminds me of what i think about when i think
            about grout. dipping things into this requires maximum precision due
            to the sheer gravitas (and gravitational pull) that it possesses..
            as does breaking the plastic seal when you open this bad boy up..
            with that being said!! tastes great. you cannot go wrong with garlic
            or basil. and it might be some sunk cost fallacy stockholm syndrome
            logic kicking in but this flavour bomb paste holds may be well worth
            the effort you put into consuming it.. a good post-arm day cooldown,
            if you will!!
